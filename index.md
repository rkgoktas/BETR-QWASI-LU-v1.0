Welcome to BETR-QWASI-LU-v1.0 website!

BETR-QWASI-LU-v1.0 is a spatially resolved QWASI model for vertically layered coastal waters with Uncertainty Analysis.

BETR-QWASI-LU has been developed as a part of a research project funded by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) (Project Number: 118Y155).

The source code of BETR-QWASI-LU is based on [BETR-Global 4.0](https://github.com/BETR-Global/BETR-Global-4.0) by Matthew MacLeod and Fangyuan Zhao. [The Python 3.0 patch of BETR-Global 4.0](https://github.com/barronh/BETR-Global-4.0/tree/enhancement-python3) by Baron Henderson facilitated the code development.
