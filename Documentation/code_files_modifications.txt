	Other methods coming from BETR-Global 4.0 are commented out since they are not needed.
emissions.py
	This module reads emission files and hands out emission-vectors.

		class Emission:
			def __init__(self,fn):
				[m,r,c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,c7,c8,c9,c10,val1,val2,val3,val4,val5,val6,val7,val8,val9,val10] changed to [m,r,c1,c2,val1,val2]
			def get_emission:
				BETR-QWASI modification is made.
BETRS.py
	Modified methods:
		class Model():
			self.update_dvalues_flows_Q() commented out.
			self.update_dvalues_mix_Q() commented out.
	Added methods:
		mc_envpar: updates environmental parameters for Monte Carlo simulations
		mc_chempar: updates chemical parameters for Monte Carlo simulations

LinFluxApprox.py
	LinFluxApprox provides helpers needed for the Linear Approximation of calculated inter and intramedia fluxes.
	Modifications are needed. ***************Not done yet.**************

mkbigD.py
	The function mkbigD(m) is called from BETRS.py, calls mkflowmat and mkprocmat and returns the final list of system-matrices.
	Version of the script from BETR-Global 3.0 is used.
		Since we don't have an air compartment, the enhancements in v4.0 are not needed.
	Important Modification!!:
		In function mkflowmat:
			In original BETR-Global intra-cell flows are removed in this function
			We think this is a mistake.
			Intra-cell flows are critical in BETR_QWASI and they are not removed here.
mkDmixQ.py
	This module calculates Dmix values with Q for mixing processes of a particular model parametrization.
	This script that is added to BETR-Global 4.0 is not included in BETR-QWASI.
		Since we don't have an air compartment, the enhancements in v4.0 are not needed.

mkflowD.py
	This module calculates D-values for inter-cell transport processes of a particular model parametrization.
	Version of the script from BETR-Global 3.0 is used.
		Since we don't have an air compartment, the enhancements in v4.0 are not needed.

mkflowDQ.py
	This module calculates D-values with Q for inter-cell transport processes of a particular model parametrization.
	This script that is added to BETR-Global 4.0 is not included in BETR-QWASI.
		Since we don't have an air compartment, the enhancements in v4.0 are not needed.

output.py
	This module contains output-routines for BETR-Research
	Most of the functions will not be used by BETR-QWASI
		BETR-QWASI output functions should be developed.
			write_output_dyn_QWASI(m, fn, units) hass been added.
				called by output_dyn_QWASI in BETRS.py

readinput.py
	This module reads and batters into shape the input parameters
	*****readChemicals function may neet to be modified, but we will decide after the running the model.******

secondary_emission_reconstruction.py
	This module contains specific functions for model runs for analyzing secondary emissions.
	For now, it is not included in BETR-QWASI.

solver.py
	This module contains the ODE solver.
	No modifications are needed.???

tempcorrect.pt
	This module calculates temperature corrected fields of Koa,Kaw,Kow and
	degradation half-lifes for the selected chemical in all compartments at
	all timesteps.
	OH-radical correction is commented out since BETR-QWASI does not have an air compartment.

validate.py
	This script serves to validate BETR-Research against BETR-Global (VBA)
	Not needed for BETR-QWASI.

write_ncfile.py
	module to write an .nc - file
	Not needed for BETR-QWASI.	
	
mc.py: added for BETR-QWASI-LU
	Functions related with the Monte Carlo simulations
